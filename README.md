# ASP.NET Core ToDo Sample using PostgreSQL and Entity Framework Core

This application demonstrates how to use the ElephantSQL PostgreSQL Database Service in an ASP.NET Core application running on Bluemix.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy)

## Running the app on Bluemix

1. Create a Bluemix Account

  [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account.

1. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

1. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool and follow the prompts to log in.

  ```
  cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  ```

1. Create the ElephantSQL service instance in Bluemix
  ```
  cf create-service elephantsql turtle elephant-sql-service
  ```

1. Push the app to Bluemix
  ```
  cf push
  ```

## Run the app locally

1. If you do not already have a Bluemix account, [sign up here][sign_up]
1. If you have not already, install ASP.NET Core and the Dotnet CLI by following the [Getting Started][] instructions
1. Clone the app to your local environment from your terminal using the following command:

  ```
  git clone https://ketatasedki@bitbucket.org/ketatasedki/workshop-elephant.git
  ```

1. `cd` into the newly created directory
1. Create an ElephantSQL service instance using the Bluemix UI or the following command:

  ```
  cf create-service elephantsql turtle elephant-sql-service
  ```

1. Copy the value for the service credentials from your ElephantSQL service instance in Bluemix and paste it in the `src/CoreMVC/vcap-local.json` file
1. Restore required Nuget packages

  ```
  dotnet restore
  ```

1. Run the application

  ```
  dotnet run -p src/CoreMVC
  ```

1. Access the running app in a browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Decomposition Instructions

The primary purpose of this demo is to provide a sample application which uses Entity Framework to connect to the ElephantSQL service in Bluemix.
Most of the relevant code for this integration is located within the `src/CoreMVC/Startup.cs` file.

## Troubleshooting

The primary source of debugging information for your Bluemix app is the logs.  To see them, run the following command using the [Cloud Foundry CLI][cloud_foundry]:

```
cf logs ElephantCore --recent
```

Replace `ElephantCore` with the actual name of your application in Bluemix.
